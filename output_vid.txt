%HESITATION before we begin let password important question why lord bison why no Java C. C. plus plus other dozens of programming languages out there let me ask you this question first from the perspective of a programming beginner my son is one of the easiest language to learn because the first easy to use index take a look at this program to add two numbers written in Java you don't need to understand it yet.
now let's see how we would write the same program and buy from.
advocacy the price of gold looks much more readable the simplicity of five from syntax allows you to focus on the logic rather than focusing on syntax that's the reason why fight from the start of the first programming language in many many universities another reason to learn by that is because of its growing popularity and applications my son is used in machine learning web development data analysis scientific research automation and many more five and is used by many companies such as Google Facebook Netflix and so on it is also used by thousands and thousands of small companies if you're looking for a job in programming you'll find plenty of opportunities if you know my friend now let's start learning by ten but before that we need to be able to run bison I use an online tool created by the program's team run by then online for the CD's let me open my browser and I'll go to the U. R. L. that you can see on the screen I've also posted the link in the description below we will write my son in this text India and when I hit run if it is a good that code it's that easy you can use a simple if you want or you can also use a beginner friendly I.
