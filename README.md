## **Conflict Plan**
###	What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
- Our group will meet online and talk about it, we will respect each other’s opinions and only talk in a respectable manner.

###	What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
- before we start we will divide the project into tasks and each one of us will take his task based on each one knowledge and if someone isn’t participating enough they can contribute to the work by being in a driver role.


###	How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
- We will divide the tasks based on the preference of the team members so that the team member will be enjoying doing their task.

###	How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
- We can discuss why this happened and try to give them small tasks also the leader will keep up with the team 

###	How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
- We can discuss the different opinions and thoughts and share them with all of the group members and then take a vote on what to do next.
- When we fail to find a common solution together and the votes are equal and the problem is critical to the workflow we will let our instructor/TA help us with it.
